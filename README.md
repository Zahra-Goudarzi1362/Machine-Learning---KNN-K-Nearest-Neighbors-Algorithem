# Machine-Learning---KNN-K-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithem
 Prediction of The possibility of diabetes by KNN = K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithem-Machine Learning - 
We check different number for K to check its acuuracy. 
Creat a 'For loop' to avoid checking different k. In this loop we check accuracy from k=0 to 20 to find best accuracy. k=7 had a better accurecy. 
We use also plot to compare training_acc and test_acc which resulted in k=7 had best accuracy. 
To improve our model and become sure for this K number we used GridSearchCV algorithm which created the same result.
